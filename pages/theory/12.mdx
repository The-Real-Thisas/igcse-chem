# Sulfur

Sources
-------

-   Found as an element, in large underground beds

-   Found around the rims of volcanoes.

-   It occurs in metal ores e.g. lead sulphide

-   Sulphur compounds also occur naturally in the fossil fuels e.g. coal

Uses
----

| Sulfur | Sulfur Dioxide |
| --- | --- |
| As a food preserver; kills bacteria | Manufacture of sulphuric acid |
| As a bleach in the manufacture of wood pulp for paper | To bleach wool, silk and wood pulp for making paper |
| In car batteries as electrolyte | As a sterilising agent in making soft drinks and jam, and in drying fruit; stops growth of bacteria and moulds. |
| In manufacture of sulphuric acid (through Contact process) |

Contact Process
---------------

-   Sulphur is first burned in air producing sulphur dioxide

-   It is then mixed with more air and passed over four separate beds of catalyst, Vanadium (V) oxide, at 450°C to form sulphur trioxide

-   It is then dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid forming a thick fuming liquid called oleum

-   It is then mixed carefully with water to form concentrated sulphuric acid.

-   Essential conditions:

    -   Catalyst: Vanadium (V) oxide

    -   Temperature: 450°C

    -   Pressure: 2atm

Properties of Sulfuric Acid
---------------------------

-   Forms salts called sulphates

-   When concentrated, it's a dehydrating agent, and a thick oily liquid

-   It turns blue litmus red

-   It is a strong acid and has the properties of a typical strong acid: reacts with bases, low pH, high conductivity
