# The Periodic Table

-   The Periodic table is a method of classifying elements.

-   They are arranged in order of increasing atomic number.

-   Made up of rows called periods and columns called groups

-   Metals are to the left and non-metals are to the right.

-   Elements in the same group have similar properties.

-   Group number tells us the number of valency electrons and the period number tells us about the number of electron shells

Periodic Trends
---------------

-   Non-metals are on the right side of the periodic table, and metals are on the left.

-   Down a period of metals they become more reactive

-   With non-metals, going down a period, the non-metal becomes less reactive

Alkali Metals
-------------

-   Lithium, sodium and potassium

| Burst into flames when heated with oxygen:  (A red flame for lithium), (A yellow flame for sodium), (A lilac flame for potassium) | They have low densities for metals.                               |
| Produce soluble white compounds.                                                                                                  | They have low melting and boiling points compared to most metals. |
| React with cold water.                                                                                                            |                                                                   |

Patterns

-   Reactivity, density & softness increases down the group

-   Melting and boiling points decreases down the group.

-   Reactivity increases as more electron shells means there is weaker attraction between nucleus & valency electron so is lost more easily.

Transition Metals
-----------------

-   High melting points (except mercury)

-   Malleable and ductile

-   Good conductors of heat & electricity (silver is the best)

-   High density

-   Have no trend in reactivity

-   Can be used as catalysts

-   Form colored compounds

-   Can form complex ions as they have variable valences

Noble Gases
-----------

| Properties | Uses |
| --- | --- |
| Density increases down the group | Helium- filling balloons and aircrafts because it is lighter than air and will not catch fire. |
| M.p. and b.p. increases down the group | Argon -- filling (tungsten) light bulbs to stop the filament reacting with oxygen. |
| Don't conduct electricity | Neon -- is used in advertising signs because it glows red. |
| Don't take part in chemical reactions |
