# Chemical Energetics

Energetics of a Reaction
------------------------

-   Exothermic reaction: one that releases heat energy into the surrounding

-   Endothermic reaction: one which absorbs heat energy from the surroundings

-   Bond breaking is endothermic

-   Bond making is exothermic

| Exothermic reaction | Endothermic reaction |
| --- | --- |
| Energy given out to the surroundings | Energy is taken in from the surroundings |
| Surroundings become hot | Surroundings become cold |
| Bond making -- exothermic | Bond breaking -- endothermic |

Bond Energy
-----------

-   This is the amount of energy consumed or liberated when a bond is broken or formed in kJ/mol

ΔH=Bond Breaking+Bond FormingΔH=BondBreaking+BondForming

-   If overall heat energy is negative, reaction is exothermic

-   If overall heat energy is positive, reaction is endothermic

Production of Energy
--------------------

-   A fuel is a substance which can be conveniently used as a source of energy.

-   Burning fuels (like oil) to form oxides is an exothermic reaction.

-   The heat from burning fuels is used in power plants to create steam from water and turn turbines.

-   In order for any material to combust three things must be present:

    -   Fuel

    -   Heat

    -   Oxygen

-   A good fuel would:

    -   Be cheap

    -   Be available in large quantities

    -   Ba a liquid at room temperature

    -   Produce a large amount of energy when combusted

    -   Not produce polluting gases

Hydrogen
--------

-   Burns explosively with oxygen, so it is used in rockets.

-   In a fuel cell, it combines with oxygen without burning.

-   Produced by reacting methane gas with steam

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Produces a lot of energy | Difficult to transport as it is a gas at room temperature |
| Abundant on earth (sea) | Forms explosive mixture with air -- very dangerous |
| Less pollutant |  |
| Renewable fuel |  |

Simple Cells
------------

-   A cell is a device which converts chemical energy into electrical energy and is composed of two metals of different reactivity connected by an external circuit and an electrolyte

-   The process works due to the different reactivity of metals

-   Consists of a negative pole (the more reactive metal) and a positive pole (less reactive metal) and an electrolyte.

-   The greater the difference in reactivity of the two metals, the greater the voltage will be.

-   The electrons flow because one metal is more reactive, so it has a stronger drive to give up its electrons.

-   The atoms give up electrons and enter the solution as ions.

Radioactive Isotopes
--------------------

-   Uranium-235 can be used in nuclear power stations to produce electricity

-   The radioactive isotope is bombarded by neutrons resulting in a lot of heat being produced

-   Small amount of radioactive fuel produces large amount of heat

-   Advantages: lots of energy is from a small amount and no CO~2~

-   Disadvantage: radioactive waste produced and non-renewable
