# Acids, Bases and Salts

Properties of Acids
-------------------

-   An acid is a compound which when dissolved in water produces hydrogen ions (H^+^) and are described as proton donors (H^+^)

-   Acids turn blue litmus indicator paper (or solution) red.

-   Have pH 1 to 6

-   Acid + metal → salt + hydrogen gas

-   Acid + base → salt + water

-   Acid + metal carbonate → salt + carbon dioxide + water

-   Strong acids completely ionize in water producing lots of H^+^ ions

-   Weak acids partially ionize in water producing few H^+^ ions

Properties of Bases
-------------------

-   Bases are insoluble substances which neutralize acids to form a salt and water only and are proton acceptors

-   Alkalis turn red litmus indicator paper (or solution) to blue.

-   Have pH 8 to 14.

-   Base + acid → salt + water (+ CO~2~ when base is a metal carbonate)

-   Base + ammonium salt → salt + ammonia gas + water

-   Strong alkalis completely ionize in water producing lots of OH^-^ ions

-   Weak alkalis partially ionize in water producing OH^-^ ions

Neutral
-------

-   Neutral substances are pH 7.

-   Acidity in soil:

    -   Plants grow at a pH near 7.

    -   If it is too acidic or alkaline they will not grow.

    -   Acidic soil is fixed by adding lime.

-   pH is the concentration of H^+^ ions per dm^3^ of solution

Indicators
----------

| Indicator | Color in acid | Color in alkaline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phenolphthalein | Colorless | Pink |
| Methyl orange | Pink | Yellow |
| Methyl red | Red | Yellow |
| Red litmus | Red | Blue |
| Blue litmus | Red | Blue |

Types of Oxides
---------------

-   Metal oxides are basic e.g. iron oxide and magnesium oxide

-   Non-metal oxides are acidic e.g. sulphur oxide and carbon dioxide

-   Aluminum, zinc and lead form amphoteric oxides e.g. zinc oxide

-   Oxides which are neither acidic or basic are neutral e.g. water and carbon monoxide

Preparation of Salts
--------------------

-   A salt is a substance formed when all the replaceable hydrogen ions of an acid are replaced by metal ions or the ammonium ion

    -   Salts can either be soluble or insoluble

| Soluble Salts | Insoluble Salts |
| --- | --- |
| All sodium, potassium and ammonium salts |  |
| All nitrates |  |
| Chlorides | Except silver and lead |
| Sulphates | Except barium, lead and calcium |
| Potassium, sodium and ammonium carbonates | All other carbonates |


Type of Salts
-------------

| Type of Salt Required | Acid used |
| --- | --- |
| Sulphate | Sulphuric acid |
| Nitrate | Nitric acid |
| Chloride | Hydrochloric acid |
| Ethanoate | Ethanoic acid |

Starting with a Metal
---------------------

-   Add excess metal to an acid

-   When bubbling (hydrogen) stops the reaction is done

-   Filter off excess metal

Starting with an Insoluble Base
-------------------------------

-   Add insoluble base to acid and heat gently, it will dissolve

-   Keep adding until no more dissolves (reaction is done)

-   Filter out the insoluble (excess) base

Starting with an Alkali (Titration)
-----------------------------------

-   Put a certain amount alkali in a flask

-   Add phenolphthalein

-   Add acid from a burette, stirring, until it goes colorless

-   Find out how much acid you used

-   Repeat, to be more accurate

-   Evaporate water from neutral solution

Test for Aqueous Cations

| Cation | Effect of AQ. NaOH | Effect of AQ. Ammonia |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aluminum (Al^3+^) | White soluble precipitate formed giving a colorless solution | White precipitate formed |
| Ammonium (NH~4~^+^) | Ammonium gas produced turns damp red litmus blue |  |
| Calcium (Ca^2+^) | White precipitate formed | No precipitate/ slight white precipitate |
| Copper (Cu^2+^) | Light blue precipitate formed | Light blue soluble precipitate formed giving dark blue solution |
| Iron(II) (Fe^2+^) | Green precipitate formed | Green precipitate formed |
| Iron(III) (Fe^3+^) | Red-brown precipitate formed | Red-brown precipitate formed |
| Zinc (Zn^2+^) | White soluble precipitate formed giving a colorless solution | White soluble precipitate formed giving a colorless solution |
