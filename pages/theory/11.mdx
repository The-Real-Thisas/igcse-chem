Tests for Water
---------------

| Test | Type of Test | Positive Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blue Cobalt(II) Chloride Paper | Chemical | Paper turns from blue to pink |
| Anhydrous Copper(II) Sulphate powder | Chemical | From white powder to blue crystals |
| Test m.p. and b.p. | Physical | m.p. at 0°C and b.p. at 100°C |

Purification of Water
---------------------

-   Water is pumped into screens, which remove solid floating debris.

-   Aluminum sulfate is added to coagulate (stick together) small pieces of clay so that they are easily removed.

-   The water is then filtered through coarse sand to remove larger, insoluble debris.

-   The water encounters more flocculants (chemicals that make particles move down to bottom of tank) and is filtered again through fine sand.

-   Chlorine gas is bubbled through the water to kill bacteria. This makes the water slightly acidic, so to reverse this appropriate amounts of sodium hydroxide (an alkali) is added.

-   Some countries also add fluorine

Use of Water
------------

| At Home | In Industry |
| --- | --- |
| Drinking | Dissolve |
| Cooking | Wash and cool things |
| Washing | In power stations where steam is used to turn turbines |
| On farms for animals & crops |

Air
---

-   Clean air is composed of approximately

    -   79% nitrogen

    -   20% oxygen

    -   Remainder: noble gases, water vapor & carbon dioxide

Fractional Distillation of Air
------------------------------

-   Air is filtered to remove dust

-   Water vapor and carbon dioxide removed, (because they would freeze and block the pipes):

    -   air is cooled until water vapor condenses

    -   then passes over absorbent beads to trap carbon dioxide

-   It is compressed, causing it to heat up. Cooled by recycling cold air

-   The cold compressed air is passed through a jet, into a larger space. It expands rapidly, making it very cold.

-   This is repeated, cooling the air more. By -200°C it is liquid except for neon and helium. These gases are removed. They can be separated from each other by absorption on charcoal.

-   The liquid air is pumped into the fractioning column. There it is slowly warmed up. The gases boil off one by one, and are collected in tanks or cylinders.

-   Sources of methane: oil and natural gas, decomposition of vegetation, and waste gases from digestion in animals

Catalytic Convertor
-------------------

-   In the combustion engine, insufficient amounts of oxygen lead to incomplete combustion of the carbon containing fuel

-   Gases produced: (a) carbon monoxide (b) oxides of nitrogen

-   A catalytic convertor catalyzes the reduction of NO~2~ to nitrogen gas N~2~ and catalyzes the oxidation of CO to CO~2~

Rust Preventition
-----------------

-   Coating with something to prevent contact with air and moisture

    -   Plastic, paint and grease

    -   Electroplating with tin or chromium

    -   Galvanising: dipping in molten zinc

-   Sacrificial protection: attaching a piece of metal that is more reactive that iron to object, commonly magnesium or zinc. This will corrode in the place of iron.

Fertilizer
----------

-   NPK used in fertilizers because:

    -   Nitrogen is needed for chlorophyll and other proteins.

    -   Phosphorus helps roots grow and crops ripen.

    -   Potassium helps make proteins and resist diseases.

-   All alkalis (except ammonia) will react with ammonium compounds, removing ammonia, for example:

Calcium hydroxide+Ammonium chloride→Calcium Chloride+Water+Ammonia

Greenhouse Gases
----------------

-   The greenhouse gases are: carbon dioxide and methane.

-   They stop heat escaping in to space.

-   Too much greenhouse gases leads to climate change.

-   This will cause the ice poles to melt, rising sea levels, more droughts, storms, floods and famine; global warming

Formation of Carbon Dioxide
---------------------------

-   Carbon dioxide is produced whenever carbon or any of its compound are completely burned in excess oxygen

-   It is also formed as a product of respiration

-   It is produced as product of reaction between an acid and carbon

-   From the thermal decomposition of a carbonate

Haber Process
-------------

-   Industrial manufacture of ammonia NH~3~

N~2~ (g) + 3H~2~ (g) ⇌⇌ 2NH~3~ (g)

-   Raw materials:

    -   Nitrogen: from the air

    -   Hydrogen: methane + steam → carbon dioxide + hydrogen

-   Essential conditions:

    -   Temperature: 450°C

    -   Pressure: 200atm

    -   Catalyst: Iron
