## Symbols & Formulae of Elements & Compounds

<strong>Element symbols</strong>

<ul> 
	<li>Each element is represented by its own unique symbol as seen on the Periodic Table e.g. H is hydrogen</li> 
	<li>Where a symbol contains two letters, the first one is always in <strong>capital</strong> letters and the other is <strong>small, </strong>eg. sodium is Na, not NA</li> 
	<li>Atoms combine together in<strong> fixed ratios</strong> that will give them full outer shells of electrons</li> 
	<li>The chemical formula tells you the ratio of atoms</li> 
	<li>Eg. H<sub>2</sub>O is a compound containing 2 hydrogen atoms which combine with 1 oxygen atom</li> 
	<li>The chemical formula can be deduced from the relative number of atoms present</li> 
	<li>Eg. if a molecule contains 3 atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of nitrogen then the formula would be NH<sub>3</sub></li> 
	<li>Diagrams or models can also be used to represent the chemical formula</li> 
</ul>

<strong>Chemical formulae</strong>

<ul> 
	<li>The <strong>structural </strong>formula tells you the way in which the atoms in a particular molecule are bonded. This can be done by either a <strong>diagram</strong> (displayed formula) or <strong>written</strong> (simplified structural formula)</li> 
	<li>The <strong>empirical</strong> formula tells you the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound</li> 
	<li>The <strong>molecular</strong> formula tells you the actual number of atoms of each element in one molecule of the compound or element e.g. H<sub>2</sub> has 2 hydrogen atoms, HCl has 1 hydrogen atom and 1 chlorine atom</li> 
</ul>

<strong>Deducing formulae by combining power</strong>

<ul> 
	<li>The concept of valency is used to deduce the formulae of compounds</li> 
	<li>Valency or combing power tells you how many bonds an atom can make with another atom</li> 
	<li>Eg. carbon is in Group IV so a single carbon atom can make 4 single bonds or 2 double bonds</li> 
</ul>


## Deducing Formulae of Ionic Compounds

- The formulae of these compounds can be calculated if you know the charge on the ions.

- Below are some common ions and their charges:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr><th>Name</th><th>Formula</th><th>Valency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nitrate</td><td>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Hydroxide</td><td>OH<sup>-</sup></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Acetate/ ethanoate</td><td>CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Carbonate</td><td>CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Sulphate</td><td>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Silicate</td><td>SiO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Phosphate</td><td>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup></td><td>3</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

- For ionic compounds you have to balance the charge of each part by multiplying each ion until the sum of the charges = 0

- Example: what is the formula of aluminium sulfate?
	- Write out the formulae of each ion, including their charges
	- Al<sup>3+</sup> SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>

- Balance the charges by multiplying them out:
	- Al<sup>3+</sup> x<strong> 2</strong> = +6 and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> x <strong>3</strong> = -6; so +6 – 6 = 0
- So the formula is Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>

## Writing Word Equations & Balanced Equations

<strong>Word equations</strong>

- These show the reactants and products of a chemical reaction using their full chemical names

- The arrow (which is spoken as “goes to” or “produces”) implies the conversion of reactants into products

- Reaction conditions or the name of a catalyst can be written above the arrow

<strong>Names of compounds</strong>

For compounds consisting of 2 atoms:

- If one is a metal and the other a nonmetal, then the name of the metal atom comes first and the ending of the second atom is replaced by adding <strong>–ide</strong>

	- Eg. NaCl which contains sodium and chlorine thus becomes sodium chloride

- If both atoms are nonmetals and one of those is hydrogen, then hydrogen comes first

	- Eg. hydrogen and chlorine combined is called hydrogen chloride
 
- For other combinations of nonmetals as a general rule, the element that has a lower Group number comes first in the name

	- Eg. carbon and oxygen combine to form CO<sub>2</sub> which is carbon dioxide since carbon is in Group 4 and oxygen in Group 6

For compounds that contain certain groups of atoms:

- There are common groups of atoms which occur regularly in chemistry

- Examples include the carbonate ion(CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>), sulfate ion (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), hydroxide ion (OH<sup>–</sup>) and the nitrate ion (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>)

- When these ions form a compound with a metal atom, the name of the metal comes first

- Eg. KOH is potassium hydroxide, CaCO<sub>3</sub> is calcium carbonate

<strong>Writing and balancing chemical equations</strong>

- These use the chemical symbols of each reactant and product

- When balancing equations, there needs to be the same number of atoms of each element on either side of the equation

- The following nonmetals must be written as molecules: H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>

- Work across the equation from left to right, checking one element after another

- If there is a group of atoms, for example a nitrate group (NO3–) that has not changed from one side to the other, then count the whole group as one entity rather than counting the individual atoms.

- There are equal numbers of each atom on either side of the reaction arrow so the equation is balanced.
