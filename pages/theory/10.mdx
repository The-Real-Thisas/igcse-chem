Properties of Metals
--------------------

| Physical | Chemical |
| --- | --- |
| High density | Form basic oxides |
| Shiny when polished | Form positive ions |
| Malleable |  |
| Ductile |  |
| High m.p. And b.p. |  |
| Conductor of heat & electricity |

Alloys
------

-   An alloy is two or more metals, or a metal and non-metal which have been made molten and then mixed together

-   Alloys are used because they have improved qualities for a particular job over the pure metals

| Alloy | Made from | Special Properties | Uses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Brass | Copper and zinc | Stronger and more resistant to corrosion | Electrical fittings, car radiators |
| Bronze | Copper and tin | Harder, stronger and sonorous | Statues, springs, coins |
| Stainless steel | Iron, chromium and nickel | Does not rust | Kitchen sinks, cutlery, chemical plant |

-   Metals are often used as alloys because they have an increased range of uses and mixture of atoms gives an irregular structure which stops layers sliding over each other easily; they are stronger

-   This is what the structure of an alloy (a) looks like, compared to a pure metal (b).

Displacement Reactions
----------------------

-   These are reactions in which metals compete for oxygen or anions

-   The more reactive metal will displace the less reactive metal from oxygen or an anion.

-   If more reactive metal has oxygen or an anion, no reaction occurs

-   The bigger the difference in reactivity between the two metals, the faster the reaction

Thermal Decomposition
---------------------

| Group | Metal Carbonate | Metal Hydroxide | Metal Nitrate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Group I (except lithium)* | Do not decompose | Do not decompose | Metal nitrite and oxygen |
| *Group II, lithium & transition metals* | Metal oxide and carbon dioxide | Metal oxide and water | Metal oxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxygen |

Extraction of Metals
--------------------

-   Ores more difficult to ‎decompose from gold to potassium

-   More powerful/expensive method of ‎extraction from gold to potassium

Extracting Iron
---------------

-   Ore = hematite (Fe~2~O~3~)

-   Uses of slag

    -   To make roads

    -   To make cement

-   Coke burns with air

    *carbon + oxygen → carbon dioxide*

-   Carbon dioxide reacts with coke

    *carbon dioxide + carbon →*

    *carbon monoxide*

-   Carbon monoxide reduces Iron(III) oxide to iron

    *iron(III) oxide + carbon monoxide → iron + carbon dioxide*

-   The limestone reacts with impurities to form slag

    *calcium carbonate + silicon dioxide* → *calcium silicate + carbon dioxide*

Iron to Steel
-------------

-   Molten iron from blast furnace is poured into an oxygen furnace.

-   Calcium oxide is added, and a jet of oxygen is turned on.

-   The calcium oxide neutralizes acidic impurities, forming slag that is skimmed off and oxygen burns the other impurities away.

-   The carbon content is checked continually until it is just right then the oxygen is turned off.

    -   Mild Steel (0.25% carbon) -- Used in machinery and car bodies

    -   Medium carbon steel (0.5%) -- Used in railway lines

    -   High carbon steel (1.5% carbon) -- Used in knives and blades

Extracting Zinc
---------------

-   Ore = Zinc Blende = Zinc Sulphide (ZnS)

-   Zinc blende is roasted in air to convert it to zinc oxide

-   Zinc oxide is reduced using coke to zinc and carbon monoxide in the furnace

-   As zinc is volatile, the gaseous metal is distilled leaving less-volatile impurities behind.

-   Zinc is condensed and liquid is run into mould.

Uses of Metal
-------------

-   Aluminum

    -   Airplane/Cars (Strong/Low density/resistant to corrosion)

    -   Cans/Foil (Resistant to corrosion/malleable)

    -   Overhead cable (Good conductor of electricity/ductile)

-   Zinc

    -   Galvanizes Iron = coats it to stop it rusting

    -   Alloys -- brass/bronze

    -   Batteries

    -   Sacrificial Protection

-   Copper

    -   Electrical Wiring (Good conductor of electricity/Ductile)

    -   Cooking utensils (Malleable/good conductor of heat)

    -   Roofs (hard wearing against weather
