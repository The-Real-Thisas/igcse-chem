# Electricity and Chemistry

-   Decomposition of an electrolyte with the help of electric current

-   Electrolyte:

    -   Aq. solution of ionic substance or molten ionic salt

    -   Conducts electricity due to the presence of mobile ions

-   Electrodes:

    -   Rods which help current enter the electrolyte

    -   Inert electrodes: do not take part in the reaction

    -   Reactive electrodes: take part in the reaction

Examples

| Electrolyte | At cathode | At anode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Molten lead(II) bromide | Lead | Bromine |
| Concentrated hydrochloric acid | Hydrogen | Chlorine |
| Concentrated aqueous sodium chloride | Hydrogen | Chlorine |

Electroplating
--------------

-   Coating one metallic object with another metal using electrolysis

-   For electroplating, you need:

    -   Anode made of metal you want to electroplate object with

    -   Ions of same metal as anode in solution

    -   Object to be plated at cathode

-   Used to:

    -   Make things look better

    -   Prevent corrosion

Refining Metals
---------------

-   This is purifying impure metals

-   Rules:

    -   Cathode: thin strip of pure metal

    -   Anode: impure metal

    -   Electrolyte: Aqueous Salt Solution of metal

-   Example:

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/chemistry-0620/image029.png)![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/chemistry-0620/image030.png)

-   Reaction at Anode: Cu -- 2e Cu^2+^ (mass decreases)

-   Reaction at Cathode: Cu^2+^ + 2e Cu (mass increases)

Basics
------

-   Electrolysis is a way to decompose compounds, using electricity.

-   Reduction of positive cations happens at the cathode

-   Oxidation of negative anions happens at the anode

-   For example:

    -   At the anode: 2Cl^-^ → Cl~2~ + 2e^-^

    -   At the cathode: 2H^+^ + 2e^-^ → H~2~

Extraction of Aluminium
-----------------------

-   The main ore of aluminium is bauxite -- high m.p.

-   Aluminium (III) oxide (alumina) is dissolved in molten cryolite (Na~3~AlF~6~) -- this mixture has a lower m.p. (industrially preferred)

![](https://images.znotes.org/cie/igcse/chemistry-0620/image031.png)

-   During electrolysis aluminium is produced at the carbon cathode and oxygen at the carbon anode.

-   Due to the high temp. the oxygen reacts with the graphite anode to form CO~2~ and so anode had to be periodically replaced

Electrolysis of Brine
---------------------

-   Brine is concentrated NaCl solution

-   Ions present: Na^+^, H^+^, Cl^-^ and OH^-^

| At the anode | At the cathode |
| --- | --- |
| Made of titanium | Made of steel |
| Chlorine gas evolved | Hydrogen cations reduced to H~2~ molecules |
| Unreacted ions (Na^+^, H^+^ and OH^-^) move through porous membrane due to difference in liquid pressure | Left Na^+^ and OH^-^ which is aqueous sodium hydroxide |
| Net flow to the right |
