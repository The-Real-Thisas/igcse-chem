-   Lime is manufactured by limestone by heating

-   CaC0~3~ + heat → CaO + CO~2~

-   Uses of quick lime:

    -   Making steel from iron

    -   To neutralise acidity in soil

    -   Drying agent in industry

-   Uses of slaked lime and lime:

    -   Neutralise acidity in soil, and in lakes affected by acid rain,

    -   Neutralising acidic industrial waste products, e.g. flue gas desulphurisation

-   Uses of limestone:

    -   Making cement: made by mixing limestone with clay, heating mixture strongly in a kiln, adding gypsum (calcium sulphate), and grinding up the final solid to give a powder

    -   Making iron from iron ore: limestone reacts with sand) forming slag (calcium silicate), which is then used for road building.
